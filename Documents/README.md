# Notes regarding Pressure Control
* Pressure Relief -- Pops open and stays open
* * Relief size approximately 2x the area of the pipe
* * Example: Using a Tee 1/2 in 1/2 out  with a 3/4 T fitting.
* * The T side would be the pressure relief side

# Methodology
Gravity based controls are the most accurate and the simplest to construct. Example for a 1.2PSI relief approximately 42 quarters will provide the gravity relief
* Insert math for PSI vs mass

Gravity based 2PSI would be a 5lb weight

# TODO:
* Build Pressure relief valve
* Build Pressure Control valve (5lb 2 T)
* Build Manometer with sliding scale in the middle for evaprotation
* Contents Manometer is distilled water and food coloring
