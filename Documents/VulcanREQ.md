# SOW: Study Ad-Hoc Distributed Manufacturing of un-approved ventilators

# Introduction:
COVID-19 has exposed a critical shortage in our medical care capabilities, and supply chain. Throwing money at the vendors to produce more and faster is unlikely to work in serious world-wide pandemic where supply-chains are shut down, the need for ventilators vastly outstrips the manufacturing capability, or quarantine simply shuts down transportation.

# Motivation:
The total number of ventilators available is around 600-800k. Of the total ventilators, 80% are currently in use for car accidents, surgery recovery, etc. Even if we had 1M and 20% avail that only leave 200k avail. The CDC is predicting over 1M dead in one model.

# Question:
Can a ventilator be produced from locally procured parts by local tradespeople with no skills in the medical industry in an emergency.

# Outcome:
Proof of Concept for Quick Reactionary Capability with distributed production for medical or other emergency requirements.

# Deliverable:
* Attempt to produce a design spec, instructions, guides, and test procedures enabling local tradespeople to assemble and test the system.
* Test design for reproducibility. Generate after action report.

# Expectations:
**This is an impossible task.**

- Traditional FDA approved ventilators are complex pieces of machinery.
- Innovating a design and a functioning prototype over a 2-week period of time is a near impossible task. It is unlikely that an ideal system can be developed that meets all the desired specifications and requirements.
- However, it IS possible to get close!

# Impossible Specifications:
In order of **descending importance**, the ideal desired specifications of a Do-It- Yourself mechanical ventilator are:
1. Total Cost of all parts <$300
2. Able to be assembled and operated by low-skill levels
3. Assembled from readily available, consumer off-the-shelf parts and capabilities (Home
3D printers acceptable)
4. Capable of functioning for at least 48 hours
5. Needs to accommodate a standard 22 mm size hose that is 5 feet long (Hose design not
necessary)
6. Have a connection method to allow an adjustable O2 source to be connected
7. Capable of providing a Respiratory Rate of 12-40 breaths per minute
8. Capable of Providing 5-24 cm H20 of PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure)
9. Capable of Delivering Tidal Volumes of at least 500cc (range 160-1500cc) with every
breath
10. Capable of limiting the Peak Inspiratory Pressure to 18-40 cm H20
11. Has a method to humidify the air being delivered (in line Passive humidifiers or
alternative)
12. Powered using 120V or lower (12 V car battery)
13. Inspiratory Time of 0.4 seconds
14. Gauges or instruments to visualize delivered values and settings

# Super Long shots:
A. Provide ability to control Flow during inspiration, but if fixed: able to deliver 60L/min

B. Pressure Supportâ€”a breath triggers either a set pressure or volume of
air

C. maintains a continuous PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure)

D. Expired air scrubbing--method of absorbing or filtering the expired air
