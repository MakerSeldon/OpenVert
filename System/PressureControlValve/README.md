# Pressure Control Valve

# *Update*
Pressure control valve success today (16 Mar 20). maintained 24" with a 1/2 hole wide open. Weight based option worked. We had to add orifaces in the side of the cap to reduce the escape air resistance.

# Theory:
< insert better explanation >



The pressure control valve and monitoring system is critical to the design operating as intended. The pressure controls the system and fills the accumulator that helps the patient breathe. So over-pressurization is bad but not terrible.

# Version / Experiment 1
The design has undergone the first iteration.
