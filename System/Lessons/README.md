# Design Notes  & Lessons Learned

During the design, build, iteration, and documentation of this system, we have
learned a multitude of lessons. We believe the basic theory, and functionality
of the system complete. As with any system there is always room for improvement,
but version 1.0 is considered complete. If further funding is provided
further testing and refinement for additional field tailoring would be explored

If version 2.0 is commissioned. We believe creating a industrial WOG valve system
would be significantly more robust, and easy to produce. As this is a safety of
life system the control system would remain simple and robust. Reducing the size
to something portable could be accomplished in 30-45 days. Two paths would be
appropriate with 2 design teams.
* Continue down the field expedient path trading off robustness for capability
* Design the system more robustly while exploring parts in the supply chain.

The first option would still enable tradespeople to fabricate the systems. The second
option may require some manufacturing fabrication techniques and specialty parts.

#Lessons Learned

## Gravity: Our Friend --
In designing the system we understood that each of the trades groups would be on
their own building these systems. There would be no one to provide oversight and
calibrations. We had to keep the designs as simple as possible, and as accurate as
possible. We chose gravity, mass, and air pressure as the main methods of controls
for the systems. Below is a summation of our impressions:

Basic system concepts
* Only readily available and substitutable parts
* Gravity -- pretty constant +/- small error across the planet
* Mass -- based on gravity
* Water -- readily available
* Air pressure -- most trades people need this anyway
* Self measurement and calibration techniques
* -- Long Time differences
* -- Large Volume changes

**Calibration labs use gravity based instrumentation**

# Concept 1:
The initial concept was to build a pneumatic system that would inflate a manual
assist medical ventilation bag automatically. We joined the #OSventilator movement
and saw that was already being taken care of with multiple different efforts. We
moved on to assist those who will have no access to medical devices.

*The best mechanical squasher we have seen is the Virgin Space (Branson) rotational
electric motor driven version. It is super simple to control and fabricate. It
replaces the human with a very nice robust mechanical squasher that can deliver
repeated precise performance. The squasher should outlast the bag easily. Fabrication
should easily be in the 1000's per week depending on bag and motor availability.*

# Developing and testing the highest risk items: (PCV & Measurement)
The hypothesis that we could use a shop vac (blower side) to power the system had
to be developed first. A shop vac is a constant power device. Meaning if the
input or output becomes partially blocked the pressure increases and the flow decreases.
We needed a constant pressure system. To accomplish this we needed a way to measure
the pressure to even start.

# Manometer development
The medical folks we talked with before the Vulcan Challenge came out told us that
we needed to maintain between 40-60mmHg. Mercury is a bit challenging and difficult
to obtain and use safely. Luckily for us 1mmHg is just over 1/2" H2O. 60mmHg is 32.15".

A manometer is just a U shaped tube filled with a fluid. In our case it was water.
18" on both sides gives us a possible 36" of height measurement. We started with less
and sent water squirting across the lab it really needs to be 24" tall to get good
differential measurements. We added food coloring to make the measurements that
much easier. We went through several designs, before landing on the final one that
is super simple, low cost ($35 for 3) and highly accurate.

**Manometer is necessary, otherwise we are just guessing, and likely to injure someone**

## Pressure Control Valve
We went through multiple iterations. We knew what we needed to build. A weight
floating above a pipe that leaked air perpendicular to the force. The weight
was not going to magically be stable, so we needed a robust method that would
guild the weight as it moved up and down. The area needed to be large enough
to lift a significant weight. By using a largish weight and force area, we could
account for large power swings, and the sensitivity of the system to exact weights
was decreased. Our initial thoughts were around coinage. Coinage mass is highly
regulated and accurate. The pressure could easily be adjusted with pocket change.

But making a method to keep the coinage still was challenge. We eventually settled
on a steel pipe inside a standpipe with a cap that went overlapped the standpipe.

Our first build sent the lid into the ceiling of the lab. *After COVID crisis is
over, we will be launching all sorts of things with this system.* Version 1 of our
manometer also sprayed water at the same time. We added some air drain holes to the
overlapping cap, and it began to behave well.

Version 1 of the PCV and manometer were too complicated, we then did several iterations
on these two items to reach near our final design.

## Input filter testing
The main critical parts of the system now functional. We moved on to testing Input
air filtering.

Our First experimental concept was to use a shop vac as an air source, and filter
the output. The hypothesis was to push air into a large box with 1-3 HEPA filters
and UV lighting. The Large box should provide nice low speed laminar flow through
the filters providing for heavier particle to sink to the floor of the filter box.
The low speed laminar flow greatly aids that. The HEPA filters provide the
additional filtering, and the UV lighting in the box kills significant living
bacteria, virii, and other living things in the suspended air. The box was constructed
using cardboard, tape, shower drain fittings, and a HEPA filter.

We placed a manometer on the input and output of the cardboard filter box. It was
basically a super lossy filter. Input pressure was a nice 30 inH2O, output pressure
was around 4 inH2O. This was a failed experiment
Output:
* Shower Drain assemblies make good I/O ports as they are 2"
* Our manometers work nicely
* Filters need to be assembled like crates with the structure on the outside.

**Filters have been put on hold, as it is a construction exercise**

## Emergency Pressure Relief Valve: -- SAFETY
We understand that we are new to this world, but in the sub-sea engineering field
safety is always a concern. We added a Pressure Relief Valve to the design.
This makes the system inherently safe to the patient as the supply pressure cannot exceed
a maximum set value. We know this will work, but we are unclear if we need it yet.
Build is complete, but testing is delayed.


## Accumulator
Next is how to get that constant pressure to cycle to ON/OFF. We began to think
of this as an automated bellows. The Ambu+ bag is designed to work just that way.
We examined the build of the bag and noticed the complex network of mechanical
valves that make the bag work, and keep the patient safe.

Experiment 1:
We were going to use the Ambu+ bag as the accumulator. We tried it by stuffing the
1/2" pipe in the input side and blew air constantly, pumping the bag up nicely.
We needed something that would squash the bag reliably. The bag is shaped like
a football and must be held for operation. We decided a PACMAN or board on a hinge
was the easiest method to fabricate.

After Version 1 of PACMAN was complete, We attempted to use the Ambu+ bag, but could
not get it to reliably fill as the input side of the bag had too many relief valves.
And we couldn't get a good enough seal to lift the weight.

Experiment 2:
Replacement of Ambu+ bag with Turkey Roasting bag. We fabricated a seal with two
PVC plumbing parts, a 2" coupler and a 2" to 3/4 Reducer. This worked remarkably well.

Experiment 3:
Replacement of turkey bag with water bag. This gave us a more robust bag and a bit more
control. This what is currently being used.


## PACMAN
### Version 1: 1 4' piece of leftover laminate flooring and a piano hinge
This went poorly, the piano hinge was wrong for 2 reasons. We needed it to fully
close, but the hinge is optimized for fully opening. And it does not cut very well.

### Version 2: left over door hinge and laminate flooring
This also went poorly as the carriage bolts, we had available prevented the
closing of the hinge

### Verison 3: Hinge mounted to 2x4 block
This version works pretty well.

### Version 3a: 2x4 screwed to deck
During testing it bounced too much

### Version 3b: 1x8 replaced top board
Weight required for squashing and thin laminate flexed and bounced too much.  


## Valving
Now that we had pressure control, measurement capability, and an accumulator. It was
time to move to controlling the accumulator. We initially checked basic functionality
with manual valves. Turning them one at a time to see results. We had positive outcome.
It was time for electrically controlled valves.

We examined a multitude of possibilities.
* Our goto was Grainger for industrial WOG (Water, Oil, Gas) valves, but with a cost over
$100 each that was going to bust the budget.
* Irrigation valves were a possibility, but they are gear driven ball valves. They
are not potable water safe, and they are too slow.
* New touch valves for kitchen sinks, but the cost was prohibitive again.

One of our engineers was driving when the spotted an appliance repair shop. The
shop had a generic Hot/Cold water valve for a dishwasher. We bought a couple of
used ones and a new one for experimentation. The valves have a garden hose fittings
on the input side and a clamp bib on the output.

We installed one and checked basic flow. It worked. Later we would find out that
some valves have check valves that that have to be drilled out. But more importantly
the valve are directional. Input must come in garden side and out crimp side.

We also found later that we needed both Hot and Cold to get enough flow to operate
the system. Basic functionality was checked by manually plugging and unplugging
the power to each valve. We quickly moved to electrical control.

# Electrical Control system
The valves that were selected are 120V solenoid driven valves. When voltage is applied
the valve opens, otherwise they are normally closed to prevent water flow. A more
traditional WOG poppet valve would be better, but those are not available at local
hardware stores or readily scavenged. We are using a microcontroller in place of
analog mono-stable multivibrator (PWM circuit) that could be built from several
dimmer knobs, caps, power supply and 2 relays. We will detail that in the future.

As this is a system that needs to be highly reliable, we selected one of the simplest
microcontrollers that is readily available, the lowly Arduino. The valves only
need to be opened and closed for specific time periods. Details are
[here.](../ElectroMechanicalControlSystem/README.md) This portion went really well
as expected with a bunch of EE's and ET's on the job. Simple is BEST!

Next on the agenda is adding variability in the period - **Breaths per minute** -
and inspiration time - **Pulse Width**. And adding a dwell - **Breath Hold** - time
using simple potentiometers and 7 segment displays. Keeping it very simple.


# Test and Measurement:

Accurate field testing needs to be completed to calibrate these systems built in
the field.

* **Pressure Testing** -- Manometers are very simple for pressure checks. Measurement with
yardsticks or meter sticks are sufficient. We can put a yardstick in it and record
the video to check max pressure and plot pressure profile

* **Volumetric testing** -- Attempting to measure individual tidal values is a fools
errand. The system moves slow enough to test using averaging techniques. For this
step we needed another accumulator of known volume. Then we attached it to the patient
output of the system. We start with the bag empty, evacuated, and flat. We then
turn on the system. After the system is stable 1-5 cycles, we open the temporary
valve connecting the patient output to the bag. We then observe the bag and count
the number of cycles to fully inflate the bag.

For example we have an 8L bag. It takes 12 cycles to fully inflate the bag.

8L / 12 cycles = (8/12) L/cycle ~ 666mL per cycle with weight (x LBS)

Our desired tidal Volume is 400-700mL. We are smack in the middle.

* **Volumetric Error**
Assuming that your estimation is either -1 or +1 on the count of fully inflated
8L / 11 cycles = (8/11) 720mL  8.1% error
8L / 12 cycles = (8/12) 666mL
8L / 13 cycles = (8/13) 615mL  7.6% error

To reduce the error using a much larger vessel will reduce the percentage error.


* **Tidal Timing**  -- We control this at the millisecond level. Verification
is performed the same way -- count for 1 min and record.

* **PEEP** -- Measured with manometer
