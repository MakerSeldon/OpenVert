### positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)

### Experiment 1
Using previous experimental setup .

```
Shop-vac --> PCV --> Manometer --> Globe Valve -- Manometer --> closed
```
floods out the manometer
```
Shop-vac --> PCV --> Manometer --> Globe Valve -- Manometer --> leaky
```
Stable low pressure just based on globe valve (R inline). Makes sense constant Pressure / Voltage. Constant oriface/resistor constant Pressure Drop across valve/resistor
